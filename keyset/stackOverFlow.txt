ATECC508A Public Key configuration for ECDSA and Configuration for storing Secrets 


Hello everyone, 

I'm having issues with the configuration of ATECCX08 device. I've tried to configure the device for storing the public key that I wanted to use for verification of ECDSA signature and additionally to store the secret that I will use in my Challenge-Response algorithm. 

I managed to get a hold of the ATECC508A full datasheet where the configuration registers description is available. Here is the link to the datasheet:

Firstly I've managed to integrate the Cryptoauth Lib from microchip and get it to work, afterwards I did the configuration and writing of the data. 
Public key is located in the slot number 10, while secrets are located in slots 13 and 14. 

When I tried to perform ECDSA verification I've got
